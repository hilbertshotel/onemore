Onemore is a habit-managing tool for the browser

Usage:
    Create a new habit.
    Increment an existing habit on a daily basis.

Info:
    Once a new habit is created it automatically gets the value 1.
    Each unique habit can be incremented once per day after that.
    If the habit is not incremented until the end of a new day,
    it is automatically erased.

    Originally I had implemented a counter for the longest streak
    but then I changed my mind. No data is stored. Even if you've
    practiced a habit for 300 days, if you skip a day, you have to
    start over. Don't be fooled by achievements. The past is irrelevant.

Misc:
    And she remembered, of course she remembered, the tough sessions in Sierra Nevada in June
    at the last concentration before flying to Japan, when she was exhausted, but Del Moral
    asked her to repeat the Chatanyara Kushanku. “One more time, one more, one more. And look,
    it was worth it,“ he says.
