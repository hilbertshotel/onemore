Onemore is a habit-managing tool for the browser

Usage:
    Create a new habit.
    Increment an existing habit on a daily basis.

Info:
    Once a new habit is created it automatically gets the value 1.
    Each unique habit can be incremented once per day after that.
    If the habit is not incremented until the end of a new day,
    it is automatically erased.

    Originally I implemented a counter for the longest streak
    but changed my mind. No data is ever stored. Even if you've
    practiced a habit for 300 days, skip one day and your streak
    is lost. Don't be fooled by achievements. The past is irrelevant.

Stack:
  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Golang, MongoDB, Nginx, Systemd, AWS Lightsail
